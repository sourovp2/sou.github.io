<p>The technology and energy company DynaHex is transforming the island with technology, and they hope to use the island as an experimental base for the latest scientific research. You can enter this mode through the evolution battlefield to experience a new high-tech island. Special reminder: Players&#8217; scores in this mode are counted as ranked points.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brand new city&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>DynaHex aims at military security, energy utilization, transportation and logistics, forward-looking scientific research and other fields, and uses high technology to transform the six regional urban areas of the island</p>
<p><strong>Transportation hub (formerly Pochinki)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Pochinki is the core area of the island&#8217;s road network and has become a transportation hub. A new high-tech station and supporting transportation system will be settled in P City. The shuttle bus in the city will bring a new experience of transferring and moving shelters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Automated port (formerly Georgopol)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Georgopol continues its advantages as a logistics port and introduces a brand-new center console and technology logistics warehouse to become a highly efficient and advanced logistics port.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Technology Center (formerly School)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The area that was once a school is now positioned more towards academic scientific research and advanced exploration. The latest scientific research results and advanced technologies will be displayed here. In terms of play style, there are abundant pathways and structures, as well as dense but changeable conflict possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security Center (formerly Military Base)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The military base is responsible for the security monitoring and armed support of the entire island, and the island-wide monitoring and rapid response facilities are set up here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Logistics Center (formerly Yasnaya Polyana)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The logistics center is located in Yasnaya Polyana, which will become an important distribution center for materials entering the island. The materials transported from the port will be classified, security checked, and distributed here, and will be diverted to various areas of the island through scientific and technological means.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Energy Center (formerly Mylta Power</strong>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organization that provides energy for the island combines conventional energy with advanced energy, and the energy center provides stable energy for civilian and military buildings on the island&nbsp;</p>
